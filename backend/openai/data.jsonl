Fighting took place throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Pacific, and parts of Asia. One of the deadliest wars in history, it resulted in an estimated 9 million soldiers dead and 23 million wounded, plus another 5 million civilian deaths from various causes. Millions more died as a result of genocide, and the war was a major factor in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. The first decade of the 20th century saw increasing diplomatic tension between the European great powers. This reached a breaking point on 28 June 1914, when a Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. Austria-Hungary held Serbia responsible, and declared war on 28 July. Russia came to Serbia's defence, and by 4 August, Germany, France, and Britain were drawn into the war, with the Ottoman Empire joining in November of that same year. Germany's strategy in 1914 was to first defeat France, then transfer forces to the Russian front. However, this failed, and by the end of 1914, the Western Front consisted of a continuous line of trenches stretching from the English Channel to Switzerland. The Eastern Front was more dynamic, but neither side could gain a decisive advantage, despite costly offensives. As the war expanded to more fronts, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Italy and others joined in from 1915 onward. In early 1917, the United States entered the war on the side of the Allies, and later the same year, the Bolsheviks seized power in the Russian October Revolution, making peace with the Central Powers in early 1918. Germany launched an offensive in the west in March 1918, and despite initial success, it left the German Army exhausted and demoralised. A successful Allied counter-offensive later that year caused a collapse of the German frontline. By the end of 1918, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary agreed to armistices with the Allies, leaving Germany isolated. Facing revolution at home and with his army on the verge of mutiny, Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated on 9 November."},{"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"flashcards\": [{ \"term\": \"World War I\", \"definition\": \"Also known as the First World War, it was a global conflict fought between two coalitions, the Allied Powers and the Central Powers.\" }, { \"term\": \"Allied Powers\", \"definition\": \"A coalition of countries including Britain, France, Russia, and later the United States, that fought against the Central Powers in World War I.\" }, { \"term\": \"Central Powers\", \"definition\": \"A coalition of countries including Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire, that fought against the Allied Powers in World War I.\" }, { \"term\": \"Archduke Franz Ferdinand\", \"definition\": \"Heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, whose assassination by Gavrilo Princip in 1914 triggered the start of World War I.\" }, { \"term\": \"Trenches\", \"definition\": \"Long, narrow ditches dug into the ground, used for protection and to defend positions during World War I.\" }, { \"term\": \"Western Front\", \"definition\": \"The line of trenches stretching from the English Channel to Switzerland where the majority of fighting took place between the Allied and Central Powers in World War I.\" }, { \"term\": \"Eastern Front\", \"definition\": \"The region where the fighting between the Allied and Central Powers took place in Eastern Europe and Russia during World War I.\" }, { \"term\": \"United States\", \"definition\": \"A country that entered World War I on the side of the Allies in 1917.\" }, { \"term\": \"Russian October Revolution\", \"definition\": \"The revolution in Russia in 1917 that led to the Bolsheviks seizing power and making peace with the Central Powers in World War I.\" }, { \"term\": \"Armistice\", \"definition\": \"A formal agreement to stop fighting, often used to refer to the agreements that ended World War I.\" }, { \"term\": \"Kaiser Wilhelm II\", \"definition\": \"The German emperor who abdicated on 9 November 1918, marking the end of World War I for Germany.\" }]}"}]}

Typical implementations allocate contiguous memory words for the elements of arrays (but this is not always a necessity). Arrays may be fixed-length or resizable. A linked list (also just called list) is a linear collection of data elements of any type, called nodes, where each node has itself a value, and points to the next node in the linked list. The principal advantage of a linked list over an array is that values can always be efficiently inserted and removed without relocating the rest of the list. Certain other operations, such as random access to a certain element, are however slower on lists than on arrays. A record (also called tuple or struct) is an aggregate data structure. A record is a value that contains other values, typically in fixed number and sequence and typically indexed by names. The elements of records are usually called fields or members. In the context of object-oriented programming, records are known as plain old data structures to distinguish them from objects.[11] Hash tables, also known as hash maps, are data structures that provide fast retrieval of values based on keys. They use a hashing function to map keys to indexes in an array, allowing for constant-time access in the average case. Hash tables are commonly used in dictionaries, caches, and database indexing.

Iago reassures Roderigo that he hates Othello. Chief among Iago’s reasons for this hatred is Othello’s recent promotion of Michael Cassio to the post of lieutenant. In spite of Iago’s service in battle and the recommendation of three “great ones” of the city, Othello chose to give the position to a man with no experience leading men in battle. As he waits for an opportunity to further his own self-interest, Iago only pretends to serve Othello. Iago advises Roderigo to spoil some of Othello’s pleasure in his marriage by rousing Desdemona’s family against the general. The two men come to the street outside the house of Desdemona’s father, Brabantio, and cry out that he has been robbed by “thieves.” Brabantio, who is a Venetian senator, comes to the window. At first, he doesn’t believe what he hears, because he has told Roderigo to stay away from his daughter before and thinks Roderigo is merely scheming once again in order to see Desdemona.

However, OpenGL by itself is not an API, but merely a specification, developed and maintained by the Khronos Group.\n\nThe OpenGL specification specifies exactly what the result/output of each function should be and how it should perform. It is then up to the developers implementing this specification to come up with a solution of how this function should operate. Since the OpenGL specification does not give us implementation details, the actual developed versions of OpenGL are allowed to have different implementations, as long as their results comply with the specification (and are thus the same to the user).\n\nThe people developing the actual OpenGL libraries are usually the graphics card manufacturers. Each graphics card that you buy supports specific versions of OpenGL which are the versions of OpenGL developed specifically for that card (series). When using an Apple system the OpenGL library is maintained by Apple themselves and under Linux there exists a combination of graphic suppliers' versions and hobbyists' adaptations of these libraries. This also means that whenever OpenGL is showing weird behavior that it shouldn't, this is most likely the fault of the graphics cards manufacturers (or whoever developed/maintained the library).\nSince most implementations are built by graphics card manufacturers, whenever there is a bug in the implementation this is usually solved by updating your video card drivers; those drivers include the newest versions of OpenGL that your card supports. This is one of the reasons why it's always advised to occasionally update your graphic drivers.\n\nKhronos publicly hosts all specification documents for all the OpenGL versions. The interested reader can find the OpenGL specification of version 3.3 (which is what we'll be using) here which is a good read if you want to delve into the details of OpenGL (note how they mostly just describe results and not implementations).

But that doesn't mean you really get the basics of accounting. Like many careers, accounting is a mix of tactical and analytical tasks. And it's not just recording transactions or doing taxes. Accounting is thinking about what your financial records will mean to regulators, agencies, and tax collectors. If you're in charge of accounting, it's not just numbers and receipts. It's a process of gathering and reporting financial information. You'll use those reports to communicate the cash flows, financial position, and performance of your business. Understanding accounting often begins with learning basic terms and principles. These can help you learn the foundation of accounting. Then, it's about learning how you can apply these practices. But before we dig into those ideas, let's talk about what day-to-day work looks like for an accountant.\n\nWhat do accountants do every day?\nAccountants oversee the financial records for a business and make sure the data is correct. Then, they use this data to create budgets, financial documents, and reports. Examples of this might include a cash flow statement for operations or an income statement for an upcoming board meeting.\n\nThey also attend meetings to offer advice or look into legal issues. Other common activities include:\n\tCollecting new financial data\n\tReviewing or updating past records\n\tCollecting evidence for audits and other legal proceedings\n\tComputing taxes\n\tChecking on compliance with relevant laws\n\tMaking sure tax payments are on time\n\tForecasting and risk-assessment\n\nFlashcards:\n{\"term\": \"What is Accounting?\", \"definition\": \"The practice of recording, organizing, and reporting financial information for businesses and individuals.\"}\n{\"term\": \"What are Financial Records?\", \"definition\": \"Documents that track financial transactions and activities within a business or organization.\"}\n{\"term\": \"Who are Regulators?\", \"definition\": \"Government or industry authorities responsible for overseeing and enforcing financial rules and regulations.\"}\n{\"term\": \"What are Cash Flows?\", \"definition\": \"The movement of money in and out of a business, which accountants analyze and report.\"}\n{\"term\": \"What is Financial Performance?\", \"definition\": \"Refers to how well a business is doing financially, often assessed through income statements and other financial reports.\"}\n{\"term\": \"What are an Accountant's Daily Tasks?\", \"definition\": \"The responsibilities of accountants, including overseeing financial records, creating budgets, preparing financial documents, attending meetings, collecting and reviewing data, ensuring compliance with laws, and forecasting.\"}\n{\"term\": \"What are Audits?\", \"definition\": \"Examinations of financial records to ensure accuracy and compliance with regulations.\"}\n{\"term\": \"Forecasting and Risk Assessment\", \"definition\": \"Evaluating future financial trends and potential risks to help businesses make informed decisions.\"}"},{"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"flashcards\": [{\"term\": \"What is Accounting?\", \"definition\": \"The practice of recording, organizing, and reporting financial information for businesses and individuals.\"}, {\"term\": \"What are Financial Records?\", \"definition\": \"Documents that track financial transactions and activities within a business or organization.\"}, {\"term\": \"Who are Regulators?\", \"definition\": \"Government or industry authorities responsible for overseeing and enforcing financial rules and regulations.\"}, {\"term\": \"What are Cash Flows?\", \"definition\": \"The movement of money in and out of a business, which accountants analyze and report.\"}, {\"term\": \"What is Financial Performance?\", \"definition\": \"Refers to how well a business is doing financially, often assessed through income statements and other financial reports.\"}, {\"term\": \"What are an Accountant's Daily Tasks?\", \"definition\": \"The responsibilities of accountants, including overseeing financial records, creating budgets, preparing financial documents, attending meetings, collecting and reviewing data, ensuring compliance with laws, and forecasting.\"}, {\"term\": \"What are Audits?\", \"definition\": \"Examinations of financial records to ensure accuracy and compliance with regulations.\"}, {\"term\": \"Forecasting and Risk Assessment\", \"definition\": \"Evaluating future financial trends and potential risks to help businesses make informed decisions.\"}]}"}]}

A neuron is composed of three sections: the soma (cell body), which contains the nucleus of the cell, dendrites that receive chemical messengers from other neurons, and an axon that sends signals to other cells via electrical and chemical (neurotransmitter) signals. Neurons send signals to other cells with chemical neurotransmitters. However, because neurons can be up to three feet long, they have a unique way of sending the signal from one end of the axon to the other via electrical signals called action potentials. When a neuron receives a neurotransmitter signal from another cell, the axon fires an action potential down to the axon terminal (end of the axon), where the electrical signal is converted back into a chemical neurotransmitter and is able to signal neighboring cells.\n\nSince action potentials take about one millisecond to travel the length of the axon, it could be expected that neurons fire constantly, but this is not the case. Each time after an action potential is fired, the neuron undergoes refractory periods. What is refractory period? During refractory period, neurons reset and cover after firing an action potential. There are two types of refractory periods, absolute and relative. The absolute refractory period occurs immediately after an action potential is fired and it is not possible for another action potential to be produced.

But if you experience insomnia or poor sleep quality at night, napping might worsen these problems. Long or frequent naps might interfere with nighttime sleep.\n\nWhen should I consider a nap?\nYou might consider making time for a nap if you:\n\tExperience new fatigue or unexpected sleepiness\n\tAre about to experience sleep loss — for example, due to a long work shift\n\tWant to make planned naps part of your daily routine\n\nFlashcards:\n{\"term\": \"What are some Benefits of Napping?\", \"definition\": \"The advantages of taking a nap for healthy adults, including relaxation, reduced fatigue, increased alertness, improved mood, and enhanced performance in terms of reaction time and memory.\"}\n{\"term\": \"What are some Drawbacks of Napping?\", \"definition\": \"Potential negative effects of napping, such as sleep inertia (grogginess after waking up) and the possibility of worsening nighttime sleep problems.\"}\n{\"term\": \"Define Sleep Inertia\", \"definition\": \"The groggy and disoriented feeling that can occur after waking up from a nap or sleep.\"}\n{\"term\": \"What are Nighttime Sleep Problems\", \"definition\": \"Issues related to sleep quality at night, which can be exacerbated by napping, particularly if the naps are long or frequent.\"}\n{\"term\": \"When to Consider a Nap?\", \"definition\": \"When it's appropriate to take a nap, including if you're experiencing fatigue or unexpected sleepiness, anticipate sleep loss (e.g., due to work shifts), or want to incorporate planned naps into your daily routine.\"}"},{"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"flashcards\": [{\"term\": \"What are some Benefits of Napping?\", \"definition\": \"The advantages of taking a nap for healthy adults, including relaxation, reduced fatigue, increased alertness, improved mood, and enhanced performance in terms of reaction time and memory.\"}, {\"term\": \"What are some Drawbacks of Napping?\", \"definition\": \"Potential negative effects of napping, such as sleep inertia (grogginess after waking up) and the possibility of worsening nighttime sleep problems.\"}, {\"term\": \"Define Sleep Inertia\", \"definition\": \"The groggy and disoriented feeling that can occur after waking up from a nap or sleep.\"}, {\"term\": \"What are Nighttime Sleep Problems\", \"definition\": \"Issues related to sleep quality at night, which can be exacerbated by napping, particularly if the naps are long or frequent.\"}, {\"term\": \"When to Consider a Nap?\", \"definition\": \"When it's appropriate to take a nap, including if you're experiencing fatigue or unexpected sleepiness, anticipate sleep loss (e.g., due to work shifts), or want to incorporate planned naps into your daily routine.\"}]}"}]}

You should look for misspellings, homonyms, grammar and punctuation errors, Smith said. Careless email mistakes will only make you look bad to your recipients.\n\n“These errors look unprofessional and reduce the likelihood that the email will be taken seriously,” added Schweitzer. “Email software comes with many professional tools such as spell check. Use them.”\n\nDo: Stay concise\nIt’s always best to keep your emails short and sweet. Emails are not meant to be as brief as text messages, Smith said, but they are meant to be a form of quick communication. If your email is too wordy, try editing it down to make it more concise.\n“Recipients will only read the first line or two before deciding whether to keep or delete [an email],” Smith said. “Be sure you are saying what you need to say sufficiently.”\n\nDo: Keep Calm\nNever send any email while you are angry or otherwise emotional, Smith advised. Instead, try to calm down and then speak to the person you need to address face-to-face or over the phone if an in-person meeting is not possible. Doing so could help you avoid an unnecessary altercation, Smith said.\n\nFlashcards:\n{\"term\": \"Dos in Email Etiquette\", \"definition\": \"Positive practices to follow when composing and sending emails.\"}\n{\"term\": \"What is a Proper Salutation?\", \"definition\": \"Using respectful and appropriate greetings like 'good morning,' 'good afternoon,' or 'hello' when addressing recipients, particularly in professional or new contact settings.\"}\n{\"term\": \"What is Proofreading?\", \"definition\": \"Thoroughly reviewing and editing your email for errors, including misspellings, grammar, and punctuation mistakes.\"}\n{\"term\": \"Why be Concise?\", \"definition\": \"Keeping emails short and to the point for efficient and effective communication, while avoiding excessive wordiness.\"}\n{\"term\": \"What is meant by Keeping Calm?\", \"definition\": \"Avoid sending emails in anger or when emotionally charged; instead, address the issue in person or over the phone to prevent unnecessary conflicts.\"}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"flashcards\": [{\"term\": \"Dos in Email Etiquette\", \"definition\": \"Positive practices to follow when composing and sending emails.\"}, {\"term\": \"What is a Proper Salutation?\", \"definition\": \"Using respectful and appropriate greetings like 'good morning,' 'good afternoon,' or 'hello' when addressing recipients, particularly in professional or new contact settings.\"}, {\"term\": \"What is Proofreading?\", \"definition\": \"Thoroughly reviewing and editing your email for errors, including misspellings, grammar, and punctuation mistakes.\"}, {\"term\": \"Why be Concise?\", \"definition\": \"Keeping emails short and to the point for efficient and effective communication, while avoiding excessive wordiness.\"}, {\"term\": \"What is meant by Keeping Calm?\", \"definition\": \"Avoid sending emails in anger or when emotionally charged; instead, address the issue in person or over the phone to prevent unnecessary conflicts.\"}]}"}]}

For example, this might be when they:\n\tare getting cranky\n\thave been sitting still for a long time\n\tare having trouble sharing or taking turns with others.\nPointing out something interesting, starting a simple game, pulling funny faces – you’ve probably come up with many tricks like these to distract your child.\nDistraction usually works. So it’s a great option for encouraging positive behaviour in many situations.\n\nTips for distracting children and encouraging positive behaviour\nHere are distraction tips that usually work for children of all ages:\n\tTune in to your child’s behaviour, and try distracting your child when you first notice them getting frustrated, bored or cranky.\n\tGive your child something else to do. Introduce a new activity, toy or game, or show your child something new they can do with the toy they already have.\n\tChange the scene. Put your child where they can see different things, or move your child to a new spot either inside or outside.\n\tThink ahead. Have a few ideas for fun activities. It could be as simple as planning some outside play when you can see that your child is getting bored inside.\n\tSing some songs or rhymes together. This can be useful when you can’t stop what you’re doing, like when you’re driving or cooking.\n\tIf you’re out and about, take some toys or books that you can pull out when you need them.\n\nFor older children, you can try these ideas as well as the tips above:\n\tChange the topic of conversation.\n\tSuggest a simple game or activity. For example, suggest your child tries a jigsaw or a game of Uno if they say they have nothing to do.\n\tSuggest a break when things aren’t going well. For example, you could say, ‘Looks like you’re feeling frustrated with your drawing. What about riding your scooter instead?’\n\tSuggest your child does something they usually enjoy, like reading their favourite book or listening to some music.\n\nIf you sense that your child is bored and needs distraction, why not encourage your child to come up with their own ideas? Making the most of boredom can be great for your child’s creativity and problem-solving skills.\n\nWhen not to use distraction to change children’s behaviour\nDistraction works best when you can see that your child is about to get upset or behave in a challenging way.\nDistraction won’t help if your child:\n\thas hurt someone\n\tis having a tantrum\n\tis very upset.\n\nIn situations like these, it’s best to deal with the behaviour directly.\nFor example, if your child has hurt another child, it might be tempting to distract both children with toys or activities. But this doesn’t help your child understand that it isn’t OK to hurt other people. It might be better to use quiet time or time-out, if your child is old enough to understand these consequences.\nAlso, trying to distract your child when they’re having a tantrum might send the message that your child’s strong feelings aren’t important. Instead you can use time in to help toddlers calm down or our steps for helping older children calm down.\n\nFlashcards:\n{\"term\": \"What is Distraction in Behavior Management?\", \"definition\": \"A strategy involving shifting a child's attention away from frustrating or challenging situations to more engaging or interesting activities to encourage positive behavior.\"}\n{\"term\": \"What are good Situations for Using Distraction?\", \"definition\": \"Appropriate times to use distraction, such as when a child is getting cranky, has been sitting still for a long time, or is having trouble sharing or taking turns with others.\"}\n{\"term\": \"What are some Distraction Tips for Encouraging Positive Behavior?\", \"definition\": \"Useful strategies for distracting children, including introducing new activities, changing the environment, planning fun activities, singing songs, bringing toys or books, and encouraging creativity when boredom strikes.\"}\n{\"term\": \"When Not to Use Distraction?\", \"definition\": \"Instances where distraction may not be effective or appropriate, such as when a child has hurt someone, is having a tantrum, or is very upset, and alternative approaches like addressing the behavior directly or using quiet time or time-out are more suitable.\"}\n{\"term\": \"What is a Distraction Strategy?\", \"definition\": \"A technique that shifts a child's attention from frustrating or boring situations to more engaging or interesting activities to encourage positive behavior.\"}\n{\"term\": \"What are Effective Distraction Situations?\", \"definition\": \"Appropriate times to use distraction, including when a child is becoming irritable, has been sedentary for an extended period, or is struggling with sharing or taking turns with others.\"}\n{\"term\": \"What are some Distraction Tips for Children?\", \"definition\": \"Useful strategies for distracting children, such as introducing new activities, altering the environment, planning enjoyable activities, singing songs, bringing toys or books, and promoting creativity during moments of boredom.\"}\n{\"term\": \"What are some Inappropriate Distraction Scenarios?\", \"definition\": \"Instances where distraction may not be a suitable approach, like when a child has caused harm to someone, is experiencing a tantrum, or is highly upset, and alternative methods such as addressing the behavior directly or implementing quiet time or time-out are more suitable.\"}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"flashcards\": [{\"term\": \"What is Distraction in Behavior Management?\", \"definition\": \"A strategy involving shifting a child's attention away from frustrating or challenging situations to more engaging or interesting activities to encourage positive behavior.\"}, {\"term\": \"What are good Situations for Using Distraction?\", \"definition\": \"Appropriate times to use distraction, such as when a child is getting cranky, has been sitting still for a long time, or is having trouble sharing or taking turns with others.\"}, {\"term\": \"What are some Distraction Tips for Encouraging Positive Behavior?\", \"definition\": \"Useful strategies for distracting children, including introducing new activities, changing the environment, planning fun activities, singing songs, bringing toys or books, and encouraging creativity when boredom strikes.\"}, {\"term\": \"When Not to Use Distraction?\", \"definition\": \"Instances where distraction may not be effective or appropriate, such as when a child has hurt someone, is having a tantrum, or is very upset, and alternative approaches like addressing the behavior directly or using quiet time or time-out are more suitable.\"}]}"}]}

Following the MPC’s promulgation, many states’ criminal codes underwent significant reforms, and to this day, many states’ criminal codes are based on the MPC.\n\nThe MPC is comprised of four parts: (I) general principles of liability; (II) definitions of specific offenses; (III) provisions governing treatment and correction; and (IV) provisions governing the organization of corrections departments and divisions.\n\nTwo of the MPC’s parts have gained historic significance: (I) the general principles of liability and (II) the definition of specific offenses. The sentencing, treatment, and corrections portions of parts III and IV were not as well-received and were quickly left behind.\n\nThe MPC defined crimes using an elements analysis to distinguish between the different elements of a crime that are required for liability.
